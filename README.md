## How to use

1. Get your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

2. Copy the plug-in file into directory:

    - Windows: Copy the plug-in file into %SystemDrive%%ProgramFiles%\OmegaT\plugins directory.
    - macOS: Copy the plug-in file into /Applications/OmegaT.app/Contents/Java/plugins directory.
    - GNU/Linux: Copy the plug-in file under the directory that OmegaT installed.

3. Set your OpenAI key.

    - Windows: Open the file %SystemDrive%\%ProgramFiles%\OmegaT\OmegaT.I4J.ini and add this line:
    ```
    -Dopenai.api.key=YOURAPIKEY
    ```

    - macOS: Open the file /Applications/OmegaT.app/Contents/Resources/Configuration.properties with text editor and add this line:
    ```
    openai.api.key=YOURAPIKEY
    ```
   
    - In case of running the program with command line prompt, add this parameter:
    ```
    -Dopenai.api.key=YOURAPIKEY
    ```
   
4. (Optional) Configure model and temperature:

   - Model (default is `gpt-4o`):

     ```
     -Dopenai.model=YOURMODELNAME
     ```

     Example: `-Dopenai.model=gpt-4o-mini`

   - Temperature (default is `0`):

     ```
     -Dopenai.temperature=YOURTEMPERATURE
     ```

     Example: `-Dopenai.temperature=0.5`

   Add these to the same configuration files as in step 3, or use as command line parameters.
